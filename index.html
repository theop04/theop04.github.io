      <p>Hi, my name is Theodore Weicker!</p>
      <p>I'm from <em>Copenhagen, Denmark</em> but I moved to The Bay during covid.</p>
      <p>I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering major and Data Science minor.</p>
      <p>
        A fun fact about me is that I am Theodore Weicker <strong>the fifth (V)</strong>, which
        is on my American passport but not my Danish one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love working out, playing pickleball, and recently I learned to ride
        the motorcycle :D
