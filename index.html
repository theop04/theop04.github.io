          <p>Hi, my name is Theodore Weicker!</p>
          <p>
            I'm from <em>Copenhagen, Denmark</em> but I moved to The Bay during
            covid.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering major and Data Science minor.
          </p>
          <p>
            A fun fact about me is that I am Theodore Weicker
            <strong>the fifth (V)</strong>, which is on my American passport but
            not my Danish one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love working out, playing pickleball, and recently I learned to
            ride the motorcycle :D
